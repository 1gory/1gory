I'm interested in job opportunities that involve working with Node.js and related technologies.
I've been working as a backend developer for various companies since 2013. 
In addition, I have been engaged in freelancing and entrepreneurial activities since 2017.
Since 2018, I've been primarily using Node.js and React for my new projects.
