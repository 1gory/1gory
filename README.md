Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹\
I'm eager to contribute my expertise to exciting and challenging projects. I'm particularly interested in job opportunities that align with my experience and knowledge in Node.js and its associated technologies.\
I've been working as a backend developer for various companies since 2013. \
In addition, I have been engaged in freelancing and entrepreneurial activities since 2018.\
Since 2018, I've been primarily using Node.js and React for my new projects.
